## Specific Questions to Research

### 1. **Hot Leads Definition & Identification**
- What behaviors define a "hot lead" for e-commerce (time on page, cart abandonment, multiple visits, etc.)?
- Which tracking mechanisms work best for identifying hot leads without complex infrastructure?
- Should we focus on cart abandoners, or also include high-engagement non-converters?
- What timeframe defines a "hot" lead (24 hours? 48 hours? 1 week)?

### 2. **Email Sequence Strategy**
- How many emails should be in the hot leads sequence?
- What should be the timing between emails? (e.g., 1 hour, 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days)
- Should the sequence differ for:
  - Cart abandoners vs. browsers?
  - Self-buyers vs. gift buyers?
  - Mobile vs. desktop users?

### 3. **Email Content & Copywriting**
- What subject lines have the highest open rates for cart abandonment emails?
- Should we use:
  - Discount/urgency tactics?
  - Emotional storytelling?
  - Social proof emphasis?
  - FAQ/objection handling?
- What's the optimal email length for hot leads?
- Should we include video or just images?

### 4. **Pregnancy/Baby Market Specific Considerations**
- How do pregnancy-related purchases differ from general e-commerce?
- Should we emphasize the pregnancy timing urgency (weeks 28-36)?
- How to ethically use urgency without being pushy to pregnant women?
- Should we address partner/family involvement in messaging?

### 5. **Technical Implementation (Low-Tech Solutions)**

### 6. **WhatsApp vs Email for Hot Leads**

### 7. **Conversion Optimization Tactics**
- Should we offer incentives? (free shipping already included)
- What alternative CTAs work (WhatsApp consultation, video tutorial preview, etc.)?
- Should we create urgency (limited stock, pregnancy timing window)?
- How to address common objections in email (safety, skill level, delivery time)?

### 8. **Legal & Cultural Considerations**
- What are Colombia's email marketing regulations (GDPR-equivalent)?
- Do we need explicit consent for cart abandonment emails?
- Cultural tone: Formal vs. informal Spanish for Colombian pregnant women?
- Should emails come from personal founder vs. brand name?

### 9. **Content Variations to Test**
- Email 1: Subject line and approach options
- Email 2: Follow-up angle options
- Email 3: Last chance or social proof focus?
- Should we personalize by:
  - Products viewed?
  - Time spent on site?
  - Referral source (Instagram, Google, etc.)?

### 10. **Success Metrics & Benchmarks**
